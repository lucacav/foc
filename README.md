# Foundations of Cybersecurity

This is the public repository for the "Foundations of Cybersecurity" course held at University of Pavia. 

----

üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø The **goal** of the course is to provide a high-level view of the main cybersecurity aspects at the basis of modern software and network ecosystems. The course will allow to understand vulnerabilities and weaknesses plaguing the software, recognize bad security practices and major attack models, as well as to autonomously retrieve information on malware and network threats. 

The **prerequisites** for the course are: basic understanding of operating systems and hardware architectures, basic knowledge of programming and of the most popular network protocols. 

The course is **organized** in indpenendet **modules**, each one investigating a major topic in cybersecurity related to the role of a professional engineer.

üáÆüáπ L'obiettivo del corso √® fornire una panoramica dei principali aspetti di cybersecurity alla base dei moderni ecosistemi software e infrastrutture di rete. Il corso consentir√† di comprendere le vulnerabilit√† e le debolezze del software, riconoscere le cattive pratiche di sicurezza, i principali modelli di attacco, e di reperire autonomamente informazioni su malware e minacce informatiche.

I **prerequisiti** del corso sono: conoscenza di base dei sistemi operativi e delle architetture hardware, nozioni di base di programmazione e dei protocolli di rete pi√π diffusi.

Il corso √® **organizzato** in moduli che trattano un tema base della sicurezza informatica di particolare rilevanza per la figura dell'ingegnere.

**Important**: this repository will be udpadted during the year according to the **actual** schedule of the course. The language of the course (including all the materials) is **english**. 

## Organization of the Repository

Each module has its own set of material, which may vary according to the topic. The general organization of the the repository uses the following folders:

- Slides: the .pdf version of the slides;
- Examples: various examples shown during the course, e.g., code, scripts, and outputs;
- References: reference research papers that can provide details for studying the topic or useful directions for further investigations;
- Misc: videos, reports, and simple PoC tools to make a topic clearer (and more enjoayble).

## Module 0 - Foreword

This module discusses some bureaucracy and rules (e.g., what is needed to pass the course) just to crack the ice. 

## Module 1 - Introduction and Basics

This module addresses some introductory information (e.g., the relevance of cybersecurity aspects), the Cyber Kill Chain, concepts related to the attack surface and attack surface reduction practices, and a brief discussion on the importance of considering human aspects. The related material contains some reference paper and reports. 

## Module 2 - Security Analysis and Modeling

This module covers how some security aspects can be analyzed and modeled. Specifically, it covers the Common Weaknesses Enumeration (CWE), the Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), as well as a basic discussion on testing approaches (static and fuzzing). The related material contains some reference paper and tutorial/challenge for fuzz-testing the xpdf package via the AFL fuzzer. 




## Acknowledgments 

The material used during the course and collected in this repository has been prepared with the help of many colleagues. Angelica Liguori is the owner of the code for watermarking AI models, while Marco Zuppelli prepared the digital media and network traffic examples. Giacomo Benedetti provided several examples, code, and ideas on the security of the software supply chain. Luca Veltri and Matteo Repetto shared the material used in their network security course.
